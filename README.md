Idea based on the alarm: https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/

Song file is not included, replace "FallWithMe.mp3" with any .mp3 file that is located in the same directory.

Added the following functionality:
Countdown timer
Snooze option
Different tkinter layout
Counts down the seconds on the same line in the terminal
